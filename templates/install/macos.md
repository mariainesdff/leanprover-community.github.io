# How to install Lean 4 on MacOS

This document explains how to get started with Lean 4 if you
are using MacOS.

If you get stuck, please come to [the chat room](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) to ask for assistance.

## Installing Lean 4

### Intel Macs

Here we will discuss the fast way, assuming a lot of trust from you. It
will install Lean, with supporting tools `elan` and `lake`, 
as well as the code editor VS Code and its Lean plugin.
If you don't like this method, there is a
[detailed webpage](macos_details.html) which will decompose the
process into described stages, and won't ask for a blind `sudo`.

The fast way is: open a terminal and type:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/master/scripts/install_macos.sh)" && source ~/.profile
```

### M1 Macs / Apple Silicon

Given that GitHub Actions does [not yet support builds on Apple
ARM](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/2187), installation
of Lean is for the moment a bit more complex.

Specifically, `elan` – which is installed
as part of the above instructions – will not be able to fetch Lean binaries on
these devices if installed the normal way.

The following instructions are adapted from [Fedor Pavutnitskiy](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/M1.20Macs.3A.20Installing.20the.20Lean.203.20toolchain/near/262832039), and allow you to install elan through [Rosetta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment).

1. Open a new terminal window and install XCode Command Line Tools and Rosetta 2 using `xcode-select --install` and `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`.

2. We will install a second, separate x86 installation of Homebrew, which is easiest done by running a shell entirely using Rosetta 2. Do so by running `arch -x86_64 zsh`. The remainder of the commands below should be run from within this `x86`-running window, though once the steps have been completed, the installed tools will work in any future shell.

3. Install a second installation of Homebrew for `x86` with `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`. It will automatically install itself into a second location (`/usr/local`, rather than `/opt/`).

4. Follow the same steps described in [Controlled Installation for macOS](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos_details.html) using the `brew` you just installed:

```
/usr/local/bin/brew install elan-init
elan toolchain install stable
elan default stable
```

5. Install Visual Studio Code and the Lean extension via `brew install --cask visual-studio-code && code --install-extension leanprover.lean4` (both the x86 and ARM versions of `brew` should work).

There is a [Zulip thread](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/M1.20macs)
with some interim further details and advice. If you have trouble, feel free to ask for help.

## Lean Projects

You can now read instructions about creating and working on [Lean projects](project.html)

If you encounter any `command not found` errors when opening a new terminal,
logging out from MacOS and logging in again should fix it.
